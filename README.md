# What is Tic Tac Toe?

Tic Tac Toe is a turn-based game played by 2 players. The first player to form a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row of 3 of their own markers wins. Players also have to attempt to prevent the opponent from achieving the same objective, by blocking their opponent from lining up 3 of their own markers in a row. 

The game can result in a win-lose, or a draw.
